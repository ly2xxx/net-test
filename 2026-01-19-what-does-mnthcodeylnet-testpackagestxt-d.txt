> what does '/mnt/h/code/yl/net-test/packages.txt' do? And how is it related
 to '/mnt/h/code/yl/net-test/requirements.txt' ? 

● I'll read both files to explain their purpose and relationship.

● Read(packages.txt)
  ⎿  Read 24 lines

● Read(requirements.txt)
  ⎿  Read 6 lines

● Based on reading both files, here's the relationship:

  packages.txt - System-Level Dependencies

  This file lists Linux system packages (Debian/Ubuntu apt packages) needed
  for running headless browsers. The packages include:
  - Browser runtime libraries (NSS, NSPR)
  - GUI libraries (GTK, GDK)
  - X11 display libraries
  - Graphics rendering (Cairo, Pango, GBM)
  - Audio support (ALSA)

  These are the low-level system dependencies required for browser
  automation tools like Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium to run in
  headless mode.

  requirements.txt - Python Dependencies

  This file lists Python packages installed via pip:
  - streamlit - Web application framework
  - netpull - Likely a web scraping/browser automation library

  How They Relate

  They work together for Streamlit Cloud deployment:

  1. requirements.txt → Installs Python packages via pip
  2. packages.txt → Installs system packages via apt-get (Ubuntu/Debian
  package manager)

  Streamlit Cloud (and similar platforms like Heroku with Apt buildpack)
  automatically reads packages.txt to install system-level dependencies
  before running your Python app. Since netpull likely uses browser
  automation, it needs the browser system libraries listed in packages.txt
  to function properly.

  In summary: requirements.txt handles Python-level dependencies, while
  packages.txt handles OS-level dependencies needed for those Python
  packages to work.
